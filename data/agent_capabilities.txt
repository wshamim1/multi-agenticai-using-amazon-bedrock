Agent Integration Patterns:
==========================

1. Sequential Processing:
   - Supervisor receives query
   - Identifies required agents
   - Invokes agents in sequence
   - Aggregates responses
   - Returns unified answer

2. Parallel Processing:
   - Multiple agents invoked simultaneously
   - Responses collected concurrently
   - Results merged and formatted
   - Faster response times for multi-domain queries

3. Conditional Routing:
   - Query analysis determines agent selection
   - Only relevant agents are invoked
   - Efficient resource utilization
   - Optimized response generation


Best Practices for Agent Usage:
==============================

1. Weather Queries:
   - Always specify the city name
   - Use common city names or major cities
   - Be specific about what weather information you need

2. Stock Queries:
   - Include company name or ticker symbol
   - Use standard ticker symbols (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL)
   - Specify if you need specific metrics

3. News Queries:
   - Mention the topic or category
   - Be specific about the type of news (business, tech, sports, etc.)
   - Indicate if you want recent or trending news

4. Multi-Agent Queries:
   - Clearly separate different information requests
   - Use "and" to combine multiple queries
   - Be explicit about what you need from each domain


Error Handling:
==============

Each agent includes robust error handling:
- Invalid city names: Returns error message with suggestions
- Unknown stock tickers: Provides similar ticker suggestions
- No news found: Suggests alternative topics or broader searches
- API failures: Graceful degradation with cached data when available


Performance Metrics:
==================

Typical Response Times:
- Weather queries: 1-2 seconds
- Stock queries: 1-2 seconds
- News queries: 2-3 seconds
- Multi-agent queries: 3-5 seconds

Accuracy:
- Weather data: Real-time from reliable sources
- Stock prices: Live market data with minimal delay
- News articles: Curated from reputable sources
