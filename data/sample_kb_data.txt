Amazon Bedrock Multi-Agent System Documentation

Overview:
This document provides comprehensive information about the Amazon Bedrock Multi-Agent System, which enables intelligent collaboration between specialized AI agents to handle complex queries.

System Architecture:
The system uses a SUPERVISOR_ROUTER pattern where a supervisor agent coordinates multiple specialized collaborator agents. Each agent has specific expertise and can be invoked based on the user's query requirements.

Available Agents:

1. Weather Agent
   - Provides current weather information for any city
   - Returns temperature, conditions, humidity, and wind speed
   - Example query: "What's the weather in New York?"
   - Capabilities: Real-time weather data retrieval

2. Stock Agent
   - Retrieves stock market information
   - Provides current stock prices and market data
   - Example query: "What's the current price of AAPL stock?"
   - Capabilities: Stock price lookup, market analysis

3. News Agent
   - Fetches latest news articles on various topics
   - Provides headlines and summaries
   - Example query: "What are the latest technology news?"
   - Capabilities: News aggregation, topic-based search

Technical Components:

AWS Services Used:
- Amazon Bedrock: Foundation models and agent orchestration
- AWS Lambda: Serverless function execution for agent actions
- Amazon S3: Document storage for knowledge base
- Amazon OpenSearch Serverless: Vector database for semantic search
- AWS IAM: Identity and access management

Foundation Models:
- Primary Model: Amazon Nova Pro 1.0
- Embedding Model: Amazon Titan Text Embeddings v1
- Knowledge Base Model: Amazon Titan Text Premier v1

Multi-Agent Collaboration:
The supervisor agent uses the SUPERVISOR_ROUTER collaboration mode to:
1. Analyze incoming user queries
2. Determine which specialized agent(s) to invoke
3. Route requests to appropriate collaborator agents
4. Aggregate responses from multiple agents
5. Provide comprehensive answers to users

Knowledge Base Integration:
The system includes a knowledge base powered by Amazon OpenSearch Serverless that:
- Stores and indexes documentation
- Enables semantic search capabilities
- Provides context-aware responses
- Supports RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

Use Cases:

1. Weather Information Queries
   - "What's the weather like in San Francisco today?"
   - "Is it going to rain in Seattle?"
   - "What's the temperature in Miami?"

2. Stock Market Queries
   - "What's the current stock price of Tesla?"
   - "How is Amazon stock performing?"
   - "What's the price of Microsoft shares?"

3. News and Information
   - "What are the latest AI developments?"
   - "Show me recent business news"
   - "What's happening in technology today?"

4. Multi-Agent Queries
   - "What's the weather in New York and what's the stock price of Apple?"
   - "Give me the latest tech news and weather forecast for Seattle"

Best Practices:

1. Query Formulation
   - Be specific about what information you need
   - Mention the city name for weather queries
   - Include stock ticker symbols when known
   - Specify topics for news queries

2. System Configuration
   - Ensure all AWS services are properly configured
   - Verify IAM permissions are correctly set
   - Check that Lambda functions are deployed
   - Confirm OpenSearch collection is active

3. Monitoring and Debugging
   - Use CloudWatch logs for troubleshooting
   - Enable trace logging for detailed execution flow
   - Monitor Lambda function metrics
   - Check agent invocation logs

Security Considerations:
- All communications are encrypted
- IAM roles follow least privilege principle
- API keys and credentials stored in AWS Secrets Manager
- Regular security audits recommended

Performance Optimization:
- Lambda functions use appropriate memory allocation
- OpenSearch collection sized for workload
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Efficient prompt engineering for faster responses

Troubleshooting:

Common Issues:
1. Agent not responding: Check IAM permissions
2. Knowledge base not found: Verify OpenSearch collection
3. Lambda timeout: Increase function timeout settings
4. Model access denied: Request model access in Bedrock console

Error Messages:
- "ResourceNotFoundException": Resource not found or not accessible
- "ValidationException": Invalid parameters or configuration
- "AccessDeniedException": Insufficient IAM permissions
- "ThrottlingException": Rate limit exceeded

Maintenance:
- Regular updates to knowledge base content
- Monitor AWS service quotas
- Review and optimize Lambda functions
- Update foundation model versions as needed

Future Enhancements:
- Additional specialized agents (e.g., calendar, email)
- Enhanced multi-modal capabilities
- Improved context retention across sessions
- Advanced analytics and reporting

Conclusion:
The Amazon Bedrock Multi-Agent System provides a powerful framework for building intelligent, collaborative AI applications. By leveraging specialized agents and AWS services, it enables sophisticated query handling and information retrieval.
